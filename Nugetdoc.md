# Rx.Net.Plus

ReactiveX gains popularity and is widely used in several platforms and languages.

If **you** have used Rx.Net (System.Reactive), you probably already wished to transform regular variable (like *int*, *bool* ) to become reactive.

What do we mean? 

We would like to:

1. React whenever variables change
2. Connect variables to observable sources
3. Not receive notification if same data is set again and again
4. Continue to use these variables as before. Compare them to values, convert them...

**Rx.Net.Plus** is a small but smart library which introduces **two** new types for this purpose (+ several extension methods):

| Type             | Purpose                                                      |
| :--------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ***RxVar***      | replace regular variables (like int, bool...)                |
| ***RxProperty*** | to replace view-model *properties* (*NotifyPropertyChanged* pattern) |
